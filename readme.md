## Description
This project aims to collect some data from a simple TXT file and render them to a clean HTML file.
The following steps allows us to accomplish this :
1. [Clean-up of the source data](#1-clean-up)
2. [Data recovery with regex](#2-data-recovery)
3. [Creation of a well structured XML file](#3-xml-generation)
4. [XSLT transformation to a clean HTML file](#4-xslt-transformation)

**Dependencies** :
- [re - Regular expresion operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
- ...

## 1. Clean-up
The source file contains some metadata, notes, preface, and index which won't be used in the scope of this project. The document also contains a table of content which would result to duplicates elements when extracting data with regular expressions. To avoid the duplicates, we **manually** remove all those elements and the table of content.

**Input** : [0_birds.txt](files/0_birds.txt)

**Output** : [1_birds.txt](files/1_birds.txt)

## 2. Data recovery

### 2.1 Data structure

Birds belongs to a Family, and Families belongs to an Order.

Each Bird has a scientific name (in latin), a common name, the name of the scientist(s) who discovered it and an habitat.

### 2.2 Expected results

As the table of content of the original document is humanly readable and accessible, we can predict the regex should return :
- 18 Orders
- 35 Families
- 204 Birds


### 2.3 Test regex
From here, we're able to create and text the regular expressions to find our data. Here's an example as how we tested the regex to extract the Orders. We used ```re.findall()``` and ```print(len())``` functions to check if the results were similar as expected.

The following regex were found :
 - Get Orders : ```Order\s[IVXL]*\.\s[A-Z \Æ]*\.```
 - Get Families : ```Fam\.\s[IVXL]*\.\s[A-Z \Æ]*```
 - Get Birds : ```[0-9]{3}\.\s[A-Z \Æ]{7,}```
